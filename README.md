# Fone-Forecaster

In this competitive mobile phone market, we simply can't rely on assumptions. To estimate the price of mobile phones that a company creates, 
we have collected sales data of mobile phones of various companies. To simplify the effort of the companies, we are up with “Fone Forecaster”.

In Fone Forecaster, the main idea is to predict the base price range of a newly released mobile phonebased on its features and specifications like 
RAM, processor, camera resolution and many more.

Fone Forecaster is a Machine Learning model which uses AUTO AI, Python programming, Flask, and HTML.
